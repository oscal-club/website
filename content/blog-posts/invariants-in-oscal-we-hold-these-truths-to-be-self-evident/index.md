Whether you are novice or expert in the realm of information security, OSCAL is fun because it brings new perspectives to many differents field in security and information technology. For example, cybersecurity and privacy policy are complex disciplines with their own methodologies and culture. The majority of their practitioners do not see their expertise as a form engineering or data science.

OSCAL changes all of that, sometimes in small ways, other times in big ways.

Since OSCAL brings data-oriented engineering culture into the domain of executives and policy analysts, a few fundamental ideas will shift the way you design and implement those policies. Even if it is unfamiliar, you can look at OSCAL from the lens of computer science and mathematics. To explore this territory, familiar or not, you can understand a lot of OSCAL's power when thinking of data in control catalog, system security plans, assessment plans, and assessment results as mathematical objects. What truths do they hold? To understand OSCAL, you must understand its invariants. These invariants are facts mathematical objects of OSCAL goodness that are true throughout its lifetime. Even if OSCAL-enabled software acts upon the data, these facts must always be true.

So what is an invariant in OSCAL? Let's examine an important example, one highlighted recently by the NIST development team as they update the profile resolution specification: equivalence of OSCAL objects.
