# Breaking News: A New Year, a New Look

Hello to and from the OSCAL Club Community. The community is small and determined, but even for the smallest of communities an easily editable website is key. So here we are! In order to allow those members passionate about compliance and security to contribute to the site directly, developer or not, I introduce the brand new site!

# What Changed?

The new website not only has some minor stylistic improvements, but big functionality enhancements.

- The use of [the US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), for a crisp look but also one that is accessible for as many users as possible.

- The adoption of [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/) and React platform, to allow for easily adaptable styling and interactivity that many web developers will find comfortable.

- Most importantly, the migration to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [NetlifyCMS](https://netlifycms.org/) as a backend. This migration allows preview versions of the website before a pull request is reviewed, all without a full developer environment on their computer.

So, get started today! You can simply click the [Help fix this site link](/admin) in the upper right-hand corner.

Even I missed some things and had to fix them _after_ the launch, you can check them out [the changes I made with NetlifyCMS here](https://github.com/oscal-club/website/pull/2).

Oh, and expect more blog post series on the intersection of OSCAL and other topics soon. The new workflows will benefit all of us.

As we like to say in the OSCAL Club Community: 

> World unification equals world domination, have a nice day!

Hopfully, I will get feedback from you soon. (Hey, see what I did there? I look forward to the first fix!)
